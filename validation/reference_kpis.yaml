# Reference KPIs for baseline validation
# Expected values for the 8-station Delhi NCR network
# Targeting moderate, realistic operational metrics

city_kpis:
  avg_wait_time: 4.5       # minutes - good service level (±20% tolerance)
  lost_swaps_pct: 12.0     # ~12% lost - room for improvement (±25% tolerance)
  charger_utilization: 0.72  # 72% - healthy utilization (±15% tolerance)
  idle_inventory_pct: 28.0   # 28% buffer stock
  throughput: 52.0         # ~52 swaps/hour across network
  cost_proxy: 35.0         # balanced cost score

# Expected scenario impact ranges:
# - Weather (rain): lost_swaps 12% → 18%, wait 4.5 → 6.5 min
# - Festival/IPL: throughput 52 → 68, lost 12% → 20%
# - Add 2 stations: lost 12% → 7%, revenue +₹25K/day
# - Reduce capacity: utilization 72% → 88%, lost 12% → 25%

# Note: Validation focuses on wait_time, lost_swaps_pct, and charger_utilization
# Other metrics are informational
