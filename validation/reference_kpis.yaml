# Reference KPIs for baseline validation
# These are expected values for the baseline_example.yaml configuration
# With charge_duration=60min (1 hour fast charging) and increased station capacity

city_kpis:
  avg_wait_time: 5.0       # minutes (±15% tolerance)
  lost_swaps_pct: 22.0     # percentage (±15% tolerance)
  charger_utilization: 0.69  # 0-1 scale (±10% tolerance)
  idle_inventory_pct: 26.0   # percentage of capacity that is charged/idle
  throughput: 41.0         # swaps per hour
  cost_proxy: 50.0         # cost score (lower is better)

# Note: Validation focuses on wait_time, lost_swaps_pct, and charger_utilization
# Other metrics are informational
